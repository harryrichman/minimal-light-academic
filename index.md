## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at National Taiwan University, advised by Chee-Chun Leung (梁次震).
I study equations of the form $$\int_0^\infty e^{-2\pi x^2} \, dx$$.
I am also interested in the homology groups \(H_k(\mathcal M_g, \mathbb Q)\).

## Research Interests

- **Number theory:** uniform bounds on rational points, Riemann hypothesis
