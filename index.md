## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at National Taiwan University, advised by Chee-Chun Leung (梁次震).
I study equations of the form $\int_0^\infty e^{-2\pi x^2} \, dx$.
I am also interested in the  groups \\(H_k(\mathcal M_g, \mathbb Q)\\) and 
$\pi_k(\mathrm{Sym}^\infty \mathcal M^\mathrm{trop}_g)$
.

I have experience teaching the fundamental theorem of calculus
\\[ \int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a) .\\]
This is related to the isomorphism
$\mathrm{Pic}^0(X) \cong \mathrm{Jac}(X) \cong H^1(X) / H_1(X, \mathbb Z)$
when $X$ is an algebraic curve.

I grew up in [Yakima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima,_Washington), Washington.
